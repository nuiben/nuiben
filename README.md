My name is @nuiben but you can call me Ben.

Currently on my coding journey I am pursuing a degree in Software Engineering and looking to build my portfolio over the coming months. [Update by 06.2022]

Primarily I will be cofusing on HTML/CSS & Javascript along with NodeJS, but I have prior experience in C#, Java, and Python.
